# UnUniFi Protocol

![](https://img1.teletype.in/files/09/df/09df3f2f-135d-4387-857b-952388fafae2.png)

## UnUniFi

The UnUniFi protocol is a Tier 1 blockchain that provides tools and features for users to create a CDP (secured deposit position) to fuse assets tied to legal currency, using NFT and cryptocurrencies as collateral through its NFT marketplace. And this is nothing short of an entry into the NFT x DeFi area, which is now actively developing.

The protocol offers as its advantages:\
\- The largest amount of money users can borrow\
\- the lowest interest rates\
\- the longest loan duration for NFT holders.

As the team itself declares its mission: "**Give all NFTs the opportunity to DeFi"**

The project is young, at an early stage. Japanese development team from Botany LLP (Yu Kimura, Takeru Shimojima, Kenji Yanagisawa). All principal developers are members of CauchyE, Inc.

### **What problems is UnUniFi trying to solve?** <a href="#nmr8" id="nmr8"></a>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17) (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

First: NFTs are quite actively gaining popularity and widespread distribution both inside and outside of the crypto world. But, due to the fact that large amounts of capital are locked up in illiquid NFTs, many people are looking for various ways to unlock and use this liquidity without selling their NFTs.

Secondly, these are the challenges faced by today's stablecoin projects. Despite the fact that many tablecoins are backed by legitimate assets, there are certain risks of using them. For example, USDT from Tether, is secured by legal tender, but there is a risk that the issuing company could misuse the financial assets that serve as collateral. In addition, fiat-backed stablecoins are subject to regulation in various countries. Unsecured stablecoins, on the other hand, will only work if the demand for them increases over the long term. Therefore, those stablecoins that are backed by cryptocurrency are the most likely to scale.

Therefore, in an attempt to address these issues collectively, UnUniFi will allow users to issue synthetic stable assets based on NFT collateral that will be traded on its NFT Marketplace and will have rates above a certain amount as collateral.

### **How will UnUniFi work?** <a href="#6psu" id="6psu"></a>

1\. Loan of crypto assets with NFT as collateral

The moment NFT holders create a deposit against an NFT as collateral, their NFT will be placed on the marketplace. In doing so, the seller can choose one of the following two methods of placement:\
\- A method in which buyers are allowed to bid in any token\
\- the way in which buyers need to bid with a specific token (ETH, BTC, etc.)

If the seller chooses the former, it can borrow any recently released UnUniFi stablecoin, such as JPU or USU. One can borrow _**q × r%**_ of the synthetic asset, where _**q is** the average offer price up to the n-th place**, r is the**_ pledge _**ratio**_ (originally assumed to be 50%). If the seller chooses the latter, he can lend 100% of _**q**_ as the average bid price up to the **n-th** place in these tokens.

NFTs are posted free of charge, but the seller must pay a small fee to continue to post NFTs while borrowing assets from bidders. If the seller cannot pay the fees, the posted NFTs will be liquidated. The renewal fee is not paid in GUUs (UnUniFi native token), but in tokens in which the bidding/borrowing is done, respectively.

2\. bargaining

Anyone can participate in bidding by depositing tokens, depending on the NFT holder's chosen method of placement. Buyers can bid on an NFT if they want to buy and can cancel their bid if they wish. The pre-auction price, bidding price and cancellation price will be the price change information. During bidding, tokens will be locked, but participants can bid with locked tokens and receive a commission for extending the seller's placement of their NFTs. If a bidder wants to cancel their bid, some fee may be charged. Any bidder with the highest bid can buy NFTs.

3\. liquidation

If the seller is unable to pay the fees for the delayed end of listing, the NFT it has posted will be liquidated. If the seller does not want to lose the NFT, they can buy it back at a higher price than the current maximum auction price.

_EXAMPLE for JPU mint:_

* _NFT seller: places NFT in "collateral vault"_
* _bidder: places any token for trading_
* _NFT seller: mines JPU, using the buyer's proposed funds as collateral. If he wants to extend the placement period, he must pay the fee in JPU._
* _NFT seller: mines JPU, using the buyer's offered funds as collateral, and receives incremental income_

_EXAMPLE of ETH borrowing:_

* _NFT seller: places NFT in "collateral vault"_
* _bidder: places ETH for trading_
* _NFT seller: lends ETH. If he wants to extend the placement period, he must pay the fee in ETH._
* _NFT seller: receives direct profit_

### Roadmap <a href="#mcbw" id="mcbw"></a>

At the moment, the project has completed the first phase of testing and launched the beta version of the mainnet. The roadmap is not marked, but at the moment all Q2 tasks are completed by the team, which inspires a certain confidence. There are at least 2 more tests ahead of us, in which we will all be able to participate.
